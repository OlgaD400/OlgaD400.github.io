Spatiotemporal data is readily available due to emerging sensor and data acquisition tech- nologies that track the positions of moving objects of interest. Spatiotemporal clustering addresses the need to efficiently discover patterns and trends in moving object behavior without human supervision. One application of interest is the discovery of moving clusters, where clusters have a static identity, but their location and content can change over time. We propose a two phase spatiotemporal clustering method called spatiotemporal k-means (STKM) that is able to analyze the multi-scale relationships within spatiotemporal data. Phase 1 of STKM frames the moving cluster problem as the minimization of an objective function unified over space and time. It outputs the short-term associations between objects and is uniquely able to track dynamic cluster centers with minimal parameter tuning and without post-processing. Phase 2 outputs the long-term associations and can be applied to any method that provides a cluster label for each object at every point in time. We evaluate STKM against baseline methods on a recently developed benchmark dataset and show that STKM outperforms existing methods, particularly in the low-data domain, with significant performance improvements demonstrated for common evaluation metrics on the moving cluster problem.<br/><img src='/images/st_lt_stkm_clusters.pdf'><br/> Dynamic clusters, where clusters maintain a static identity, but individual objects can enter or leave the cluster at any time.
