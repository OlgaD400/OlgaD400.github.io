My name is Olga Dorabiala, and I'm a postdoctoral scholar with the AI Institute for Dynamical Systems at the University of Washington 🏔. I'm currently doing a stint in London, UK 💂‍♀️ as a visiting researcher at the Alan Turing Institute. My research is primarily focused on developing novel methods for unsupervised learning, particularly dimensionality reduction and clustering. Some of my interests include,

  * Creating methods that are robust to outliers and noise, either through techniques such as bagging and bootstrapping or by taking an optimization approach and directly augmenting a methods’ objective function. 
  * Exploring ways to provide uncertainty quantification for methods where analytical solutions are impractical.
  * Extending classical, spatial clustering methods to the spatiotemporal domain. Here, my projects have focused on clustering objects moving in space, regions of interest in videos, and vertices in evolving, dynamic networks.
  * I’m currently toying around with data-driven reduced order models (ROM) for agent-based systems (ABS). Instead of running massive simulations, can we use the output of a an ABS to create a ROM that can predict the outcome given only the initial conditions?

Outside of research, I've had the privilege of working at a handful of companies that have exposed me to a greater breadth of data science and ML techniques, such as deep learning, computer vision, anomaly detection, geospatial intelligence, natural language processing, and audio and video processing. My experiences have provided me with a strong background in mathematics, statistical analysis, and data modeling and visualization. I see myself as somebody with an overflowing “ML toolbox” and the proper intuition to know which tool to use when. At my core, I want to use machine learning to address challenging, real-world problems! 🤓

I received my PhD in Applied Mathematics with a Data Science focus, advised by Dr. Nathan J. Kutz and Dr. Aleksandr Aravkin, from the University of Washington in 2023, an MS in Applied Mathematics from the University of Washington in 2021, and a BS in Mathematics with minors in Chemistry and German from Pennsylvania State University in 2018.

When I'm not at my computer, you'll find me outside skiing ⛷, hiking 🥾, or backpacking 🎒.
